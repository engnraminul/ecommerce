## Stock Management Logic

### When Quantity Increases
```
New Stock = Current Stock - (New Quantity - Old Quantity)
```

### When Quantity Decreases
```
New Stock = Current Stock + (Old Quantity - New Quantity)
```

### When Item is Deleted
```
New Stock = Current Stock + Item Quantity
```

### When New Item is Added
```
New Stock = Current Stock - Added Quantity
```

## API Endpoints
