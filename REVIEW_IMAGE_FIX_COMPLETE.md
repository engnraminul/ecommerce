# Review Image Functionality - Fix Complete

## Problem Identified
The product review image functionality was not working due to missing serializer support and improper handling in the API layer.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing ReviewImage Serializer**
- **Problem**: No serializer existed for handling ReviewImage model
- **Solution**: Created `ReviewImageSerializer` with proper fields

### 2. **ReviewSerializer Missing Image Support**
- **Problem**: Original `ReviewSerializer` didn't handle image uploads or display
- **Solution**: Enhanced `ReviewSerializer` with:
  - `images` field for displaying review images
  - `uploaded_images` field for handling image uploads
  - Proper validation (max 5 images, 5MB each, supported formats)
  - Image creation logic in `create()` method

### 3. **Guest Review Support**
- **Problem**: Guest reviews weren't properly handled for anonymous users
- **Solution**: Fixed user assignment logic in both serializer and view

### 4. **Product Detail Missing Review Images**
- **Problem**: Product detail API didn't include review images
- **Solution**: Updated `ProductDetailSerializer.get_reviews()` to prefetch images

### 5. **Admin Interface Enhancement**
- **Problem**: No admin interface for managing review images
- **Solution**: Added `ReviewImageInline` and `ReviewImageAdmin` with image previews

## Files Modified

### `products/serializers.py`
- Added `ReviewImageSerializer`
- Enhanced `ReviewSerializer` with image support
- Added image validation and upload handling

### `products/views.py`
- Updated imports to include `ReviewImage`
- Fixed `ReviewListCreateView` for guest reviews
- Updated import statements for new serializer

### `products/admin.py`
- Added `ReviewImageInline` for review admin
- Added `ReviewImageAdmin` with image preview
- Enhanced `ReviewAdmin` with image count display

## Features Now Working

✅ **Image Upload**: Reviews can now have up to 5 images (5MB each)

✅ **Image Validation**: Proper file size and format validation
✅ **Guest Reviews**: Anonymous users can submit reviews with images
