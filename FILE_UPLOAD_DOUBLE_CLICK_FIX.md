# File Upload Double Click Fix Test

## Problem Description
When clicking the "Browse Files" button in the upload modal, the file selection dialog was opening twice:
1. Once from the browse button click event
2. Once from the upload zone click event (because the button is inside the upload zone)

## Fix Applied

### 1. Event Handling Improvements
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent browse button clicks from bubbling to upload zone
- Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent any default browser behavior
- Added check in upload zone click handler to ignore clicks on the browse button

### 2. Visual Feedback
- Added "processing" state to upload zone with visual indicators
- Temporarily disable browse button with spinner when clicked
- Added CSS classes for better user feedback

### 3. Debouncing
- Added debounce mechanism to prevent multiple rapid file selection events
- Added timeout management to clear previous timeouts
- Added processing flag to prevent overlapping operations

### 4. Debug Logging
- Added console logs to track click events
- Added logging for file selection processing
- Helps identify if the issue persists

## How to Test

1. **Open the Media tab** in the dashboard
2. **Click "Upload Files"** to open the upload modal
3. **Click "Browse Files"** button
4. **Verify** that the file selection dialog opens only once
5. **Check browser console** for debug logs showing only one file selection event

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Single file dialog opens when clicking "Browse Files"
- ✅ File dialog opens when clicking upload zone (but not on button)
- ✅ Visual feedback shows button is processing
- ✅ No duplicate file selection events
- ✅ Console logs show controlled event handling

## Code Changes Made

### JavaScript Event Handlers
```javascript
// Before (caused double triggering)
uploadZone.addEventListener('click', () => fileInput.click());
browseFilesBtn.addEventListener('click', () => fileInput.click());

// After (prevents double triggering)
uploadZone.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (!e.target.closest('#browseFilesBtn')) {
        fileInput.click();
    }
});

browseFilesBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.preventDefault();
    // Visual feedback and controlled triggering
});
```

### CSS Improvements
```css
.upload-zone.processing {
    pointer-events: none;
    opacity: 0.7;
}

.upload-zone-content button {
    pointer-events: all;
}
```

### File Selection Debouncing
```javascript
function handleFileSelection() {
    // Debounce mechanism to prevent multiple rapid calls
    if (isProcessingFileSelection) return;
    // ... processing logic
}
```

This fix ensures that the file selection dialog opens only once when the user clicks the browse button, providing a smooth and expected user experience.
