# Shipping Address Validation Fix

## Problem
The shipping address form in incomplete orders was not saving data when only first name and phone were filled, even though the backend validation was correctly set to require only these two fields.

## Root Cause
The HTML form had `required` attributes on the first name and phone input fields, which caused browser's built-in form validation to prevent form submission. The browser validation was more strict than our custom JavaScript validation.

## Solution
1. **Removed `required` attributes** from HTML form inputs
2. **Added `onsubmit="return false;"` to the form** to prevent any accidental form submission
3. **Kept custom JavaScript validation** that only requires first_name and phone fields

## Changes Made

### File: `dashboard/templates/dashboard/incomplete_orders.html`

**Before:**
```html
<form id="shippingAddressForm">
    <input type="text" class="form-control form-control-sm" id="editFirstName" placeholder="First Name *" required>
    <input type="tel" class="form-control form-control-sm" id="editPhone" placeholder="Phone *" required>
```

**After:**
```html
<form id="shippingAddressForm" onsubmit="return false;">
    <input type="text" class="form-control form-control-sm" id="editFirstName" placeholder="First Name *">
    <input type="tel" class="form-control form-control-sm" id="editPhone" placeholder="Phone *">
```

## Backend Validation
The backend validation in `dashboard/views.py` is already correctly implemented:

```python
def update_shipping(self, request, pk=None):
    # Validate required fields
    first_name = shipping_data.get('first_name', '').strip()
    phone = shipping_data.get('phone', '').strip()
    
    if not first_name or not phone:
        return Response({
            'success': False,
            'error': 'First Name and Phone are required fields.'
        }, status=400)
```

## Frontend Validation
The JavaScript validation is properly implemented:

```javascript
function saveShippingAddress() {
    const firstName = document.getElementById('editFirstName').value.trim();
    const phone = document.getElementById('editPhone').value.trim();
    
    // Validate required fields: first_name and phone
    if (!firstName || !phone) {
        Swal.fire('Validation Error!', 'First Name and Phone are required fields.', 'error');
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/mb-admin/incomplete-orders/`
2. Open any incomplete order details
3. Click "Edit" next to Shipping Address
4. Fill only First Name and Phone fields
5. Leave Address Line 1 empty
6. Click "Save"
7. **Expected Result**: Address should save successfully
8. **Previous Result**: Form validation prevented saving

## Benefits
- Customers can now save shipping addresses with minimal required information
- Improved user experience for incomplete order recovery
- Consistent validation between frontend and backend
- Maintains data integrity while being user-friendly

## Notes
- The asterisk (*) in placeholders still indicates required fields to users
- Custom validation provides better UX with SweetAlert2 notifications
- Backend validation serves as final security layer
- Form submission is completely handled by JavaScript, preventing browser interference
